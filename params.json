  "body": "MSA has been working for so long to create in house brand new logo. We proud of announcing the best 2 designs we have. Please visit both designs and come back here to vote the one you liked most.\r\n\r\n## Why a new logo?\r\nShort answer is: Because we need a new logo.\r\n \r\nMuslim Student Association of University of Notre Dame is growing by monotonically increasing both the quality and the quantity of the events with the contribution of muslim and nonmuslim members. MSA claims responsibilities on both providing the social engagement among muslim communities, and raising awareness and introducing Islam faith to non muslim audience.\r\n \r\nEven though MSA has active social media accounts and email address, an official website was also a common request from the members for a while. \r\n \r\nYet, an official website which represents the muslim community in University of Notre Dame, needs an alive and evolving design which merges the traditional islamic art and the modern lines.\r\n \r\nAs it has been a while after MSA's current logo was designed, the modern art has significantly different trends than the current logo has.\r\n\r\nThat is why we need a new and modern logo. Short of the long answer is, we need a new logo for these guys, the volunteers of MSA: \r\n\r\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qhpnUt7SUqcm8LCKnwAPzXBIz0fbr9CooGIqaEHuDkyFqf84_vcb4Z1CFji0CKUQPM94YkpzBts7btYdJEeOwZm_ye1H-HWLCuCPwYty7kkYkdjQQbCkuG2-fTxlaFKFHEQgKfxBxqmu99sReL_fnDEQpUaM42GOwQaXaHRaMb0QrPdnyVCzEzQhJNPJgAgBURyDeWEsJcsT2REz1hK5ubilzTx4HFqWRq5rHLH9dMMc502AVcZ48jzcisIPP9Vf0Pprw6yWKL3f5cJySYdJoI32PLYU8yZKZ_VHxk3E961giAgfsIYPk82FX7rpvR1dhM05NucmrYxQDe30IsfuOxFZm0nGg2r8rsVL4g4m9xdhyCwCvY1vl9bhCcSxA04tVDwPIlWI3tq5paiMfwQAKlhyizpudsDlcO2ZwVT8yhfRA1JOvZQz1NeY-hUMU-rS3MZevZ75XjsmJlph9gOww8w9KYxElraSQf1OCiFQg982AvvZ1nIyGzWyC9pCu3aGaf44Wvoq98krG28_8-WQhYPDDMmSJZ89b5v5fEciHSY2HA15b2tljHvgCCFSRg5p2PftAQ=w1333-h540-no)\r\n\r\n## Where the new logo will be used?\r\n\r\n### Website & Social Media\r\n \r\nNew logo will be the first thing people see when they first visited MSA's social media accounts or webpage.\r\n\r\n### Posters & Printed Work\r\n \r\nAs a way of raising awareness, MSA always distributes posters of events among campus, buttons, hijabs or t-shirts as give away gifts.\r\n\r\n### Gifts and Awards\r\n \r\nGifts for the guest speakers, awards in trivia games are will be customized MSA apparels and will have the MSA logo.\r\n\r\n## Your vote matters\r\nTo make the Islam's look great again, to raise the awareness more again, to break the ice once more again, to have a warm, friendly and elegant look again, we need to choose the better option all the time.\r\n \r\nBetter design comes with hard work and good feedback. We already did it to some extend. Better decision usually comes with democracy and common sense. \r\n \r\nPlease visit the description of both designs, vote for the one you liked, and leave your feedbacks for the future reference. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Design #1: Tulip\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20blue-green%20gradient%20for%20white%20background.png?raw=true\" width=\"400px\">\r\n\r\nYou may find [decomposition of Tulip Design](), symbolism ideas behind the scenes and different [color options]() on this page. \r\n\r\n## Decomposition of Tulip Design\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20Decomposition.png?raw=true\">\r\n\r\n### Crescent: \r\nAs the traditional symbol of islam, crescent lays down at the bottom of the logo\r\n\r\n### Tulip: \r\nCalligraphy is one of the most powerful arts in Islam. Traditionally in Islamic Calligraphy certain shapes are widely used for certain words. The written form of the word Allah (God) in arabic letters is frequently demonstrated in the shape of a tulip. [1,2]\r\n\r\n### Cathedral Ceiling:\r\n\r\nBack leave of the tulip is shaped similar to cathedral ceiling referring to the beautiful architecture of University of Notre Dame Du Lac.\r\n\r\n### Star of the Sea / Compass:\r\n\r\nIndeed, one of the common understandings between islam and christianity is who Mariam (Mary) is. Qur'an (the holy book of islam) mentions Mary many times, one example is enough to emphasize the holiness of Mary.\r\n\r\n> And [mention] when the angels said, \"O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds. (Qur'an: 3/42)\r\n\r\nAs one of the legitimate role models, Mary's (Mariam's, Notre Dame's) life and stories guide muslims and show the righteous path.\r\n\r\nStar of the sea symbolizes Mary in christian symbolism as the guide to the ones who sails in the sea and seeks for the righteous/straight path. [3] The symbolism of **the star of the sea** also exists in a different form in the [academic mark of the university](http://onmessage.nd.edu/notre-dame-brand-standards/logos/academic-mark/). \r\n\r\n## Colors\r\nTulip design is colored with modern flat design color palette, as well as [the official colors of the university](http://onmessage.nd.edu/notre-dame-brand-standards/color/). Each of the color combinations below can be used in different cases such as dark/light background, printed, digital etc. \r\n\r\n### Flat Design Colors\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20blue-green%20gradient%20for%20dark%20background.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20blue-green%20gradient%20for%20white%20background.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n\r\n### Mono Color \r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20mono%20color%20dark%20background.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20mono%20color%20white%20background%20gold.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20mono%20color%20white%20background%20irish%20green.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20mono%20color%20white%20background%20nd%20blue.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n\r\n### ND Colors\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20nd%20colors%20reversed.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20nd%20colors.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20nd%20colors%20dark%20background%20gold%20over%20white.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20nd%20colors%20dark%20background%20white%20over%20blue.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/Tulip%20nd%20colors%20dark%20background%20white%20over%20gold.png?raw=true\" width=\"200px\">\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Design #2: Crescent\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/CrescentLogo%20Flat%20Colored%20on%20White%204.png?raw=true\" width=\"400px\">\r\n\r\nYou may find [decomposition of Crescent Design](), symbolism ideas behind the scenes and different [color options]() on this page. \r\n\r\n## Decomposition of Crescent Design\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/agyaglikci/ndmsa-logo-design/blob/master/outputs/CrescentLogo%20Decomposition.png?raw=true\">\r\n\r\n### Crescent: \r\nAs the traditional symbol of islam, half of the logo is filled with the crescent.\r\n\r\n### Star of the Sea / Compass:\r\n\r\nIndeed, one of the common understandings between islam and christianity is who Mariam (Mary) is.

[4] According to the official page, those waves illustrates 2 lakes on campus. Even though it is not officially declared in academic mark, in MSA logo it also completes the picture with the star of the sea.\r\n\r\n## Colors\r\nCrescent design is colored with modern flat design color palette, as well as [the official colors of the university](http://onmessage.nd.edu/notre-dame-brand-standards/color/).

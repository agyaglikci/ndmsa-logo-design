Please visit both designs and come back here to vote the one you liked most.\r\n\r\n# Why a new logo?\r\nShort answer is: Because we need a new logo.\r\n \r\nMuslim Student Association of University of Notre Dame is growing by monotonically increasing both the quality and the quantity of the events with the contribution of muslim and nonmuslim members. MSA claims responsibilities on both providing the social engagement among muslim communities, and raising awareness and introducing Islam faith to non muslim audience.\r\n \r\nEven though MSA has active social media accounts and email address, for a while an official website was also a common request from the members. \r\n \r\nYet, an official website which represents the muslim community in University of Notre Dame, needs an alive and evolving design which merges the traditional islamic art and the modern lines.\r\n \r\nAs it has been a while after MSA's current logo was designed, the modern art has significantly different trends than the current logo has.\r\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qhpnUt7SUqcm8LCKnwAPzXBIz0fbr9CooGIqaEHuDkyFqf84_vcb4Z1CFji0CKUQPM94YkpzBts7btYdJEeOwZm_ye1H-HWLCuCPwYty7kkYkdjQQbCkuG2-fTxlaFKFHEQgKfxBxqmu99sReL_fnDEQpUaM42GOwQaXaHRaMb0QrPdnyVCzEzQhJNPJgAgBURyDeWEsJcsT2REz1hK5ubilzTx4HFqWRq5rHLH9dMMc502AVcZ48jzcisIPP9Vf0Pprw6yWKL3f5cJySYdJoI32PLYU8yZKZ_VHxk3E961giAgfsIYPk82FX7rpvR1dhM05NucmrYxQDe30IsfuOxFZm0nGg2r8rsVL4g4m9xdhyCwCvY1vl9bhCcSxA04tVDwPIlWI3tq5paiMfwQAKlhyizpudsDlcO2ZwVT8yhfRA1JOvZQz1NeY-hUMU-rS3MZevZ75XjsmJlph9gOww8w9KYxElraSQf1OCiFQg982AvvZ1nIyGzWyC9pCu3aGaf44Wvoq98krG28_8-WQhYPDDMmSJZ89b5v5fEciHSY2HA15b2tljHvgCCFSRg5p2PftAQ=w1333-h540-no)\r\n\r\n# Where the new logo will be used?\r\n\r\n## Website & Social Media\r\n \r\nNew logo will be the first thing people see when they first visited MSA's social media accounts or webpage.\r\n\r\n## Posters & Printed Work\r\n \r\nAs a way of raising awareness, MSA always distributes posters of events among campus, buttons, hijabs or t-shirts as give away gifts.\r\n\r\n## Gifts and Awards\r\n \r\nGifts for the guest speakers, awards in trivia games are will be customized MSA apparels and will have the MSA logo.\r\n\r\n# Your vote matters\r\nTo make the Islam's look great again, to raise the awareness more again, to break the ice once more again, to have a warm, friendly and elegant look again, we need to choose the better option all the time.\r\n \r\nBetter design comes with hard work and good feedback. We already did it to some extend. Better decision usually comes with democracy and common sense. \r\n \r\nPlease visit the description of both designs, vote for the one you liked, and leave your feedbacks for the future reference. ",
